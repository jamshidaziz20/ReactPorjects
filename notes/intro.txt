To be a great react developer do the following:
1. Decide on components
2. Decide the State and where it lives.
3. What changes when state changes.

- onclick requesting data from server, rather than html pages like before.
- all components return some jsx or react elements(HTML)
- .js and .jsx is the same thing, matter of preference.
- React has "SyntheticEvents"
- state updates are asynchronous
